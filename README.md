An Amazon like product gallery lightbox.

It is really dirt simple to use, just look to example.html on its usage.

This has been tested on:

- IE (7 and above)
- Safari 5.1 and above
- Opera 12 and above
- and Chrome (latest)

You can read a little about it here: http://sammaye.wordpress.com/2012/12/14/amazon-like-product-gallery-with-prodigal/

Note: This plugin is extemely customised to one specific use so not all of its features are there, plus it was put together in just a couple of days of procrastination so bewarned.
